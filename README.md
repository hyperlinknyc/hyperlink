# 🚀 HYPERLINK NYC - Underground Event Portal

Welcome to **Hyperlink NYC**, an invite-only underground event series.  
This site is designed to feel like a **hacked Mac terminal**, requiring a secret access code to reveal event details.

## 🎛 Features
- **Terminal-Style Interface**: Enter a code to access event information.
- **Exclusive Access**: Users must receive a texted code (future feature).
- **Easter Egg Codes**: Hidden surprises for those who find them.
- **High-BPM Club Vibes**: Jersey Club, Baile Funk, House, Disco, and Hip-Hop.

## 📍 How It Works
1. **Go to the site**: [https://hyperlinknyc.github.io/hyperlink/](https://hyperlinknyc.github.io/hyperlink/)
2. **Enter your access code** to reveal venue details.
3. If you don’t have a code, **sign up to receive one via SMS** (coming soon).

## 🔧 Setup & Development
To run the project locally:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/hyperlinknyc/hyperlink.git
cd hyperlink
open index.html  # Or use Live Server in VS Code
